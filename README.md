<h1>Paint For Kids</h1>
<h5>Paint for kids is a C++-based application designed to provide a fun and educational painting experience for children. The app offers two distinct modes:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Draw Mode:</b></b> This mode allows kids to unleash their creativity by drawing various shapes like rectangles, squares, circles, triangles, and hexagons. They can also perform actions such as undoing or redoing their strokes, recording their painting process, and selecting different fill and draw colors. Additionally, users can save their creations to text files for later viewing or editing and load previously saved drawings.</li>
  <li><b>Play Mode:</b> This interactive mode challenges kids to identify specific shapes or colors within a given scene. The game presents prompts asking users to select shapes by their type (e.g., circle, square) or color (fill or draw). As players progress, the game records their correct and incorrect answers, providing feedback and a final score at the end of the session.</li>
